# Evolution of Family Systems
Source Code of K. Itao and K. Kaneko "Evolution of Family Systems and Resultant Socio-Economic Structures" in preparation)

## One-trait model
We build a simple model of societies consisting of families which grow by the family labor and evolve strategies concerning the timing for children to leave the parent's home and the inheritance distribution among children. With evolutionary simulation, four basic family systems emerge depending on environmental parameter values. Besides, societies exhibit the characteristic wealth distribution determined by the dominant family systems therein.

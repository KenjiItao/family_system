## Simulation Model
We build a simple model of societies consisting of families which grow by the family labor and evolve strategies concerning the timing for children to leave the parent's home and the inheritance distribution among children. With evolutionary simulation, four basic family systems emerge depending on environmental parameter values. Besides, societies exhibit the characteristic wealth distribution determined by the dominant family systems therein.

See [minimal/family_system.py](minimal/family_system.py) for details.

As for extended models that include marriage process, see [extended](extended) for details.

## Data analysis
We also conducted empirical data analysis using the ethnographic database, Standard Cross-Cultural Sample.
See [data_analysis/family_system_SCCS.py](data_analysis/family_system_SCCS.py) for details.
